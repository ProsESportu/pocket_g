# Pocket G — Supabase sample

A small SvelteKit 3 + TypeScript viewer for `public.ekgemgpuls` in the
`hackyeah2026` Supabase project.

## Sample app setup

The local `.env` is configured. For a fresh checkout, copy `.env.example` to
`.env` and set your Supabase URL and publishable key. Never use a secret or
service-role key. Variables are declared in `src/env.ts` using SvelteKit 3's
explicit environment configuration.

Run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`.

The app loads the latest 100 rows through the Supabase REST API on the server.
It displays latest sensor values, an exact accessible row count, a searchable
table with 20 rows per page, and a refresh button. Search applies to the loaded
100 rows. Timestamps use Europe/Warsaw; sensor values have no assumed units.
Connection errors and empty results have dedicated states.

With user approval, the `allow_public_sample_readings` migration granted SELECT
to `anon` and added a public read policy on the existing sample table. RLS remains
enabled. Applied SQL is recorded in `supabase/sample-read-access.sql`; do not
reapply it to this project.

Validate with `npm run check` and `npm run build`.

## Original scaffold instructions

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project
npx sv create my-app
```

To recreate this project with the same configuration:

```sh
# recreate this project
npx sv@1.0.1 create --template minimal --types ts --add tailwindcss="plugins:typography" ai-tools="ide:claude-code,cursor,opencode,vscode,other+delivery:plugin+tools:mcp,svelte-code-writer,svelte-core-bestpractices,svelte-file-editor+mcpSetup:remote" --install npm ./
```

## Adding features

Add features to your project with `sv add`:

```sh
npx sv add
```

For example, to add Tailwind CSS:

```sh
npx sv add tailwindcss
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
